    <h1>Hi, I'm Marley. Thanks for stopping by!</h1>
    <div class="about-me-p">
      <p>Hi there, my name is Marley Anthony and I am a Vancouver based outdoor photographer, web developer and wedding
        photographer. A bit about me...Outside of photography, I'm very passionate about cycling and basketball. I have
        played basketball for about 15 years now and have cycled for the past 3 years.</p>
      <p>I first picked up a camera 7 years ago on a family trip to Montr√©al. Since then, I have been hooked. I taught
        myself all I could about the basics of photography and ran with it. I hope to take photos for the rest of my
        life.
        My dream places to photograph include Iceland (obviously), Patagonia (obviously) and Tonga to photograph
        humpback
        whales. Stick with my on this journey!</p>
